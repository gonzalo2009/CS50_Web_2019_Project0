Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project consists of a website with four pages. The first one is a homepage that shows some pictures related to my studies, what I like and what I do.
The second is a list with personal information, for example my name, my country, etc. The third shows a table with information about my
studies. Finally the last page talk about my interests, through descriptions and pictures.
